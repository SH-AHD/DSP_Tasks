# Digital Signal Processing Weekly Tasks

Welcome to the **Digital Signal Processing (DSP) Weekly Tasks Repository**! This repository is a collaborative project developed as part of the "Digital Signal Processing" course, aiming to apply and demonstrate key DSP concepts through hands-on coding and problem-solving.

## About the Repository

Each week, we tackle a specific task that focuses on a core DSP concept, such as filtering, Fourier transforms, convolution, and more. By implementing these concepts programmatically, we deepen our practical understanding of DSP techniques while enhancing our problem-solving skills.

This repository serves as a collection of these weekly tasks, showcasing our journey of learning and applying DSP principles.
